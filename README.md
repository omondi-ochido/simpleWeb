# My First Website

This repository contains the code for my very first website! It's a simple, multi-page website built using only HTML and CSS.

## Overview

This website is a learning project to understand the basics of web development. It includes a homepage, a projects page, an articles page, and a contact page.  It's a starting point for learning and practicing web development fundamentals.

## Technologies Used

*   HTML: For structuring the content and creating the different pages.
*   CSS: For styling the website and making it look presentable.

## How to View the Website

1.  Clone the repository: `git clone [repository URL]`
2.  Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.

Or, if you have GitHub Pages enabled for this repository:


## File Structure

*   `index.html`: The homepage of the website.
*   `projects.html`: The page showcasing my projects.
*   `articles.html`: The page for articles or blog posts.
*   `contact.html`: The contact page.
*   `style.css`: The stylesheet containing the CSS rules for the website's appearance.

## Content

The content on each page is currently placeholder text.  I plan to add more detailed information about my projects, articles, and contact details as I continue to develop the website.

## Future Improvements

*   Learn and implement JavaScript for interactive elements.
*   Make the website responsive so it looks good on different screen sizes.
*   Add more content to each page.
*   Explore using a CSS framework (like Bootstrap or Tailwind CSS).
